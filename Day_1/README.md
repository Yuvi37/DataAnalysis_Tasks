- `Z_CostContact`, `Z_Revenue`: Cost and revenue for campaigns (constant values, not used in analysis)  

## Data Cleaning Steps

### 1. Loaded the Dataset
- Imported the raw dataset from a `.csv` file using tab-separated values (`\t`) into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 2. Identified and Handled Missing Values
- Found 24 missing values in the `Income` column.
- **Action Taken**: Dropped rows with missing `Income` values.
- Verified that the dataset had no further missing values.

### 3. Checked and Removed Duplicates
- Verified duplicates using `df.duplicated().sum()`.
- **Result**: No duplicate rows were found.

### 4. Standardized Column Names
- Converted all column names to lowercase.
- Replaced spaces with underscores to improve readability and consistency.

### 5. Converted Date Columns
- Converted the `Dt_Customer` column to `datetime` format using day-first format.
- Ensured all date values were valid and consistent.

### 6. Standardized Categorical Text Values
- Cleaned up text fields such as `Education` and `Marital_Status`.
- Stripped leading/trailing spaces and standardized capitalization (title case).

### 7. Checked and Adjusted Data Types
- Ensured correct data types for all columns:
  - `Income` as float
  - `Year_Birth` as integer
  - Campaign-related flags as integers
  - Dates as `datetime` objects

### 8. Saved the Cleaned Dataset
- Exported the cleaned dataset to a new file: `cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv`.
